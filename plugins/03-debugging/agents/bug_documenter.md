Bug Fix Documentation Example
============================

Module: user_authentication.py
Bug ID: BUG-2024-001
Fix Date: 2024-08-31
Developer: Claude

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
User login fails intermittently with "Connection reset by peer" error,
affecting ~15% of login attempts during peak hours.

ROOT CAUSE:
Database connection pool was not properly handling connection timeouts.
The psycopg2 connection pool had a default timeout of 5 seconds, but
database queries during peak load were taking 8-12 seconds, causing
connections to be reset.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Increased connection pool timeout from 5s to 30s
2. Added connection health checks before query execution
3. Implemented exponential backoff retry logic
4. Added proper connection cleanup in exception handlers

CODE CHANGES:
- Modified DatabaseManager.__init__() to set longer timeout
- Added connection_health_check() method
- Enhanced error handling in execute_query() method
- Updated connection pool configuration

TESTING PERFORMED:
- Load testing with 1000 concurrent users
- Connection timeout simulation
- Database failover testing
- Performance regression testing

MONITORING ADDITIONS:
- Connection pool utilization metrics
- Query execution time tracking
- Login success/failure rate monitoring
- Database connection health checks

PREVENTION MEASURES:
- Added automated load testing to CI/CD pipeline
- Created alerts for connection pool exhaustion
- Documented proper connection pool sizing guidelines
- Added connection timeout configuration to infrastructure as code

/**
 * Bug Fix Documentation: React Component State Management
 * =====================================================
 * 
 * Component: UserProfile.tsx
 * Bug ID: BUG-2024-002
 * Fix Date: 2024-08-31
 * Developer: Claude
 * 
 * ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
 * User profile form loses unsaved changes when parent component re-renders,
 * causing frustration and data loss for users editing their profiles.
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE:
 * Component was not properly managing local state vs props synchronization.
 * When parent component re-rendered (e.g., due to navigation state changes),
 * the form was resetting to original props values, discarding user input.
 * 
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
 * 1. Added useEffect to sync props changes without overriding user edits
 * 2. Implemented isDirty state to track unsaved changes
 * 3. Added confirmation dialog before discarding changes
 * 4. Used useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders
 * 
 * TESTING PERFORMED:
 * - Unit tests for state management logic
 * - Integration tests for form persistence
 * - User interaction testing with React Testing Library
 * - Performance testing for re-render optimization
 * 
 * ACCESSIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS:
 * - Added ARIA live regions for unsaved changes warnings
 * - Enhanced keyboard navigation support
 * - Improved screen reader announcements
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
 * - Memoized expensive calculations
 * - Optimized re-render patterns
 * - Reduced bundle size by lazy loading validation
